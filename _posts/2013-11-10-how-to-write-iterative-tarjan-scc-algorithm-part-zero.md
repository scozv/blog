## Recursive DFS

It is easy to write down a recursive BFS or DFS algorithm on graph. Take DFS for example:

        function DFS(graph, node) {
          // do something on this node and mark it as visited

          (for x in graph.getAdjacentVertex(node)) {
            // then we DFS on each adjacent vertex of this node
            if (!graph.isVisited(x)) {
                DFS(graph, x)
            }
          }

          graph.markVisited(node);
        }

The call of recursive function is managed by a stack, we may see 'Call Stack', or 'Error Stack' in some IDE tools. Recursive function is brief, and it is easy to understand sometimes. But if there is limitation on stack size, We may try to write it as iterative way.

## Call Stack

Firstly, we see what happen in recursive DFS above, for the graph with only two paths:

	1 → 2 → 3
	1 → 4

we call `DFS(1)`, find `{2, 4}` as adjacent vertex, then we call <code>DFS<sub>1</sub>(2)</code> (notation  <code>DFS<sub>i</sub>(j)</code> means the parent call of `j` in stack is `i`). Next call  <code>DFS<sub>2</sub>(3)</code> finding `{3}` as adjacent vertex of `2` and finish <code>DFS<sub>1</sub>(2)</code>. Finally  call  <code>DFS<sub>1</sub>(4)</code> and finish `DFS(1)`.

## Stack Frontier

If we have a stack named `frontier`, we push `1` at first, then pop to visit `1`. Push `[4, 2]`, and pop `2`. Next push `[3]` as adjacent vertex of `2` (the stack is `( 4, 3 >` now). Finally pop `3` and `4` to finish search.

Row Index | Current `v` | Action | `frontier`
:---:|:---:|:---|:--------
 0 | 1 | initial call | ( 1 >
 1 | 1 | find `{2, 4}` as adjacent vertex of `1` | ( 4, 2 >
 2 | 2 | pop `2` to visit | ( 4 >
 3 | 2 | find `{3}` of `2` | ( 4, 3 >
 4 | 3 | pop `3` to visit | ( 4 >
 5 | 4 | pop `4` to visit| empty

(notation `( >` specifies we push and pop from right side)

## Attentions

There are two things we need to pay attentions:

* __Visiting Order__. At row index 1, we push `4` at first, in order to visit graph as same order of recursive call. However this is not very important, I just want to sync the order of iterative way and the order of recursive way. Pushing `4` at first or pushing `2` at first will get correct topological order or SCC, which we are going to find out at following two parts.
* __Vertex Status__. If we have only two paths in graph like: `1 → 2 → 3` and `1 → 3 → 4`. We have stack like this:

  Row Index | Current `v` | Action | `frontier`
  :---:|:---:|:---|:--------
  0 | 1 | initial call | ( 1 >
  1 | 1 | find `{2, 3}` as adjacent vertex of `1` | ( 3, 2 >
  2 | 2 | pop `2` to visit | ( 3 >
  3 | 2 | find `{3}` of `2` | ( 3, 3 >

  (notation `( >` specifies we push and pop from right side)

  We may notice at row index 3, we push duplicate `3` into frontier. So we need a vertex status to mark vertex as being visited or being pushed into stack (see [issue #8] [3]).

## Running Time
Here is simplified code of iterative DFS:

        function f() {
          // 0. initialize stack, O(1)

          // 1. for all vertex, O(|V|)
          while (not frontier.isEmpty()) {
            // 1.0 visit current vertex, O(1)

            // 1.1 process all vertex out from the current
            (for x in graph.getAdjacentVertex(current)) {
              frontier.push(x);
              // process each adjacent vertex of the current one
            }
          }
        }

In our code (comment 1.1) below, for each vertex, we process its adjacent vertex,
which we find from outgoing edges of current vertex.
We let the number of outgoing edges of vertex $$i$$ is $$e_i$$,
and $$n=\|V\|, m=\|E\|$$ as the number of vertex and number of edges respectively, so we write the running time as following:

$$T = O(1) + \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left [ O(1) + e_i \right ] $$

$$= O(1) + \sum_{i=1}^{n}O(1) + \sum_{i=1}^{n}e_i$$

And notice that the sum of outgoing edges of all vertex is the the number of all edges, that is $$\sum_{i=1}^{n}e_i=\left \|E \right \|=m$$, so we have:

$$T=O(1)+O(n)+O(m)=O(n+m)$$

## Next

Read code in `graph.search.js` on [Algo.js] [1], and reference [this series of posts] [2] by Tom Moertel for more details on _Recursive to Iterative_.

[Next] [4] part of this series, I am going to describe some ideas on iterative topological order algorithm which can be applied on Kosaraju SCC algorithm.

递归在某些程度上来说，很适合理解（只要找出递推公式），写起来也简单（因为它是递归）。我看过Erlang的一些介绍，这门函数式编程语言，在编译器的支持与优化下，很适合用递归。
<br />
<br />
递归的调用需要栈（Call Stack）来维护。碰到一些栈上有容量限制的语言，比如Python、JavaScript等，要么扩大栈的容量，或者如本系列文章这样，尝试将递归转化成迭代。
<br />
<br />
上面提到的深度优先查找（DFS），转化起来比较容易；而在我们第三部分将要提到的Tarjan强连通算法，转化起来就费了不少的心思（参见 <a href="https://github.com/scotv/algo-js/issues/14" target="_blank">issue #14</a>）。
<br />
<br />
当然，我认为，能够用递归的地方应该尽量用，尤其在函数式编程语言中。本系列的递归到迭代的转化，一来解决JavaScript的函数栈的容量问题，二来可以帮助我理解强连通算法。
<br />
<br />
下一篇我会整理一下拓扑排序的迭代转化，并将其应用到Kosaraju强连通算法中。
