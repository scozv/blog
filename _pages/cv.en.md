## Candidate Overview

### Three Phases of 9 Years on Software Engineering

I consider 9 years of my software engineering experiences
as three phases below.

The first phase was from 2009 when I just graduated from university to 2014. I worked
in Healthcare, Insurance project. I learnt querying the information
form the raw data, and also learnt the skill of
the data query optimization.

The second phase was from 2014 when I was enrolled into the SJTU to 2016.
I worked in a Corporate Liquidation System, the CI platform,
and I passed the CFA Level I exam.
I realized the difference between being a team developer
and being a Team Lead. I delivered a online shopping system
with 6 members part-time team, improved my decoupling and architecture ability.
Meanwhile, I started to implement fundamental algorithm with JavaScript
(see project [tango](https://scozv.github.io/tango/en/)), including linear, sorting
and basic graph algorithm.

The third phase was from September 2016 when I joined the
Infrastructure Architect Team in Hujiang to January 2017
when I moved to Singapore until now. I understand that
a programming language is the expression of requirement.
Writing the program with high quality of source code is just one step
of Software Engineering. A lot of efforts should be also applied on
deployment, monitoring, data integration, log system, health check,
and metrics, also the architecture design as well, such
as concurrent, reliability, throughput.
A project owner needs to understand
and plan the roadmap, resources (internal or external) of project.

I try to delivery the solution as scheduled,
and ensure the system keeping running. Reading
the log history of the project I own every morning
is a part of daily work if it's possible, and
building the alert for realtime monitoring is also
a part of my task.

### Next Plan

I am pushing myself to be an Architect or Leading role in Software Engineering now,
since I've already prepared a lot for this in recent 4 ~ 5 years.
