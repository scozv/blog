\maketitle

In tech's realm, I `React` and `Go`, \\
With Scala, Python, and code's flow. \\
From data streams to coding's light, \\
I lead, create, both day and night. \\

Kafka, Spark, tools of my trade, \\
Innovation's path, where I've strayed. \\
From lead roles held to coding's embrace, \\
In tech's realm, I find my place. \\

Here I stand, in the coder's fray, \\
Creating, innovating, every day. \\
In code's realm, my passion's found, \\
Where details reign, and dreams abound. \\
