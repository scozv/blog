# Abstract

> Ping++ [^pingpp] provides a facade implementation for multiple payments.
> Usually, each application we create needs a corresponding Ping++ application.
>
> In this article, I try to design a cashier microservice where only one
> Ping++ application is needed.

> This article is mainly written in Chinese.

## Term

### Application

Application is an abstract word, it can be a tiny calculation executable, or
a huge system, such as personal finance management system.

Application has different representation, like a `.exe` file, a Website or an
App installed in smart devices.

In this article, the term **Application**:

- is a system with a complete workflow,
- has a `View` as the user interface,
- has a `Server` layer,
  ï¼Šis independent from each other Application.

### View layer

I suggest to separate the `View` layer from the business server.

Here, the `View`:

- accepts the user's interaction,
- sometimes, it is also called Client side.

### RESTful Server layer

I suggest that all business servers are represented as `RESTful API`,
in this article, the terms below are all equivalent:

- Server side,
- RESTful Server
- Backend server.

### Ping++ Application

In Ping++ console page, developer can create one or more **Ping++ Application**.
Each Ping++ application has a unique `app_id`.

### Cashier

In this article, I try to design a cashier microservice where only one
Ping++ application is needed, but multiple applications can use this
cashier microservice.

## Design

### General Payment Process with Ping++ [^pingpp_charge]

### RESTful API of Cashier Microservice

```scala
// STEP 4 apply for Charge data
POST /cashier/charge

payload: {
  order: Order { _id, ...}
}

// STEP 6
RESPONSE: {
  data: Ping++ Charge data
}

// STEP 9
POST /cashier/webhook

```
